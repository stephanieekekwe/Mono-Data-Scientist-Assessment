1. Use the provided keys below to launch Mono’s widget and pull your bank statement by calling Mono’s APIs using postman or any other test tool you are comfortable with. 
Visit [https://docs.mono.co](https://docs.mono.co) for more information on how to implement Mono API.
2. Build a model that compare transaction narrations and group similar transactions in a single object. e.g if i spend NGN 5000 at Shoprite on a particular date and spend NGN 10000 on a different day, both transactions should be in the same group.
3. Calculate the average number of days between transactions in each group.
3. Create an endpoint that accepts an array of transactions fetched from Mono’s statement API and returns JSON response like the one below.
